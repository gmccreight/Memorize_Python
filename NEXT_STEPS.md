# Next Steps

The code behind the site memorizepython.com

In the manual, it talks about "Notes" and "Card Types".  In the Notes section,
it talks about note types, like cloze.  Those terms need to be taken into
consideration in the format I create for each card.

Additionally, I need to look into https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki.  This is
a good idea.  I need to see if there is traction, and what ideas I can take
from it for this site.
