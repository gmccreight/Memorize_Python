# Memorize Python

This project is two things.  First, it is a generated `Memorize_Python.json`
file (and media directory) that are used by the CrowdAnki Anki plugin.  It is
also the code behind the memorizepython.com website.

### The `Memorize_Python.json` file

The `Memorize_Python.json` file at the root of this project is actually
generated by the `mp` script.  It needs to be there for CrowdAnki to be able to
easily load it.

#### How the `Memorize_Python.json` file works

If you run `./mp compile` it takes the `data/raw` json files and turns them
into notes, then it merges those notes into the
`templates/Memorize_Python.json` file, and outputs the `Memorize_Python.json`
file at the root of this project.  That file is used by
[CrowdAnki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778) to make a deck called
"Memorize Python"

### The memorizepython.com website

There's nothing there at the moment, and nothing in here that supports the
website, but that's the future plan.

For now I'm concentrating on the Anki cards first.
