# Memorize Python

This project is two things.  First, it is the `Memorize_Python.json` file (and
media directory) that are used by the CrowdAnki Anki plugin.  It is also the
code behind the memorizepython.com website.

### The `Memorize_Python.json` file

The `Memorize_Python.json` file at the root of this project is actually
generated by the `mp` script.  It needs to be there for CrowdAnki to be able to
easily load it.
